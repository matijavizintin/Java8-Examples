# Java8-features
Test driven showcase of new features in Java 8

This project tries to show all the new features in Java 8 through tests. All the examples could be found in
test/java/com/test/* where there are JUnit @Test methods showing features through (I hope) useful and descriptive examples.
Every method has a brief java-doc describing what is the method trying to show.
